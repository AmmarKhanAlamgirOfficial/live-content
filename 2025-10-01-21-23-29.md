Washington:
US Government Shutdown Updates: The US government has officially shut down after Democrats blocked a Republican stopgap funding package that didn't address their demands. As part of the measure, the government funding expired as the clock struck midnight, and no one inside the Capitol knows what will happen next.

> Essential workers, including military personnel, will have to work without pay, while non-essential federal employees will be sent on furlough. Per nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates, as many as 750,000 federal workers could be temporarily furloughed, even if Trump doesn't proceed with permanent dismissals.

When a lapse in funding occurs, the law requires federal agencies to cease activity and furlough their "non-excepted" employees. "Excepted employees" include those who perform work to protect life and property. They stay on the job but don't get paid until after the shutdown has ended.
