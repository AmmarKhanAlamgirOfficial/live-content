  Trump:


  It was an Honor to spend time with Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, the new President
  of Syria, where we discussed all the intricacies of PEACE in the Middle East,
  of which he is a major advocate. 


  I look forward to meeting and speaking again. Everyone is talking about the
  Great Miracle that is taking place in the Middle East. Having a stable and
  successful Syria is very important to all countries in the Region.
