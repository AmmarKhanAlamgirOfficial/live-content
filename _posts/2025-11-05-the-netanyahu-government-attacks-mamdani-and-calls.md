  The Netanyahu government attacks Mamdani and calls on New York Jews to
  immigrate


  - Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir expressed concern over
  Mmdani's victory as mayor of New York, but claimed not to care about the
  "interests" of "Israel", as he described it.


  - Ben Gvir said in a statement published by the Hebrew newspaper "Israel
  Hayom": "The election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York will be
  remembered forever as a victory of anti-Semitism over sound logic".

  - Israeli Diaspora Minister Amihai Shikli also claimed that the city, which
  was a symbol of global freedom, handed over its keys to a "Hamas supporter",
  referring to the Palestinian Islamic resistance movement.

  - He considered this a critical turning point in New York's history, saying
  "New York's choice (Mamdani) undermines the foundations of the city that
  provided freedom and opportunities for success to Jewish refugees since the
  late 19th century, and became a stronghold for the largest Jewish community in
  the world"
