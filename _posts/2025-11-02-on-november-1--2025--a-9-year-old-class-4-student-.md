  On November 1, 2025, a 9-year-old Class 4 student named Amayra tragically died
  after jumping from the fourth floor of Neerja Modi School in Jaipur. CCTV
  footage showed her climbing a railing, sitting for a moment, and then leaping
  into the bushes below, suffering a fatal head injury. Upon arrival at the
  hospital, doctors declared her dead. Her father has filed an FIR against the
  school, alleging that the administration tried to conceal the incident site,
  delayed informing him about the seriousness of the situation, and that the
  principal locked the doors to prevent police entry for nearly 1.5 hours during
  the investigation.
