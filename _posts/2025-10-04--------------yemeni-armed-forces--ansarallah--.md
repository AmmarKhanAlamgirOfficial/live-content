To our heroic brothers in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements:

We are not concerned with the details of the negotiations because the decision is in your hands, but we remain committed to the covenant.

Just as our supporting military operations began at your request, they will not stop except at your request and will resume whenever you ask.

Your fate is our fate, and we are with you until victory or martyrdom”.

"And the wrongdoers will come to know what ˹evil˺ end they will meet."
