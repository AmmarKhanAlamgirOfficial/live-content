'After responsible and serious negotiations conducted by the movement and the Palestinian resistance factions regarding President Trump's proposal in Sharm El-Sheikh, aiming to reach a ceasefire to stop the genocidal war against our Palestinian people and the withdrawal of the occupation from the Gaza Strip; The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) announces reaching an agreement to end the war on Gaza, the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from it, the entry of aid, and the exchange of prisoners.

We highly appreciate the efforts of the brotherly mediators in Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, and we also value the efforts of U.S. President Donald Trump seeking to permanently stop the war and the full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza.

We call on President Trump, the guarantor countries of the agreement, and various Arab, Islamic, and international parties to force the occupation government (Israel) to fully implement the agreement's clauses, and to not allow it to renege on its promises or to delay the implementation of what has been agreed upon today.

We salute our great people in the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, the West Bank, inside and outside the homeland, who displayed unprecedented stances of dignity, heroism, and honor, and confronted the fascist occupation project targeting them and their national rights; these great sacrifices and stances thwarted the Israeli occupation's plans for subjugation and displacement.

We affirm that the sacrifices of our people will not be in vain, and that we will remain committed to the pledge and will not abandon our people's national rights until freedom, independence, and self-determination are achieved.'
