  President Trump on Hamas disarmament:

  They assured that they would disarm — that’s what they said.


  They claimed to be just gang members and so on, but in reality, these are
  extremely violent people from a very violent region.


  Whether it’s done by me, the United States, or through a proxy like Israel,
  they will be disarmed.
