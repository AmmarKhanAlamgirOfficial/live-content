  Türkiye plans to send military equipment — including drones, missiles, and
  air-defense systems — to Syria to back new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.


  Ankara seeks to expand its cross-border strike zone from 5 km to 30 km,
  focusing on areas held by the US-backed YPG/SDF, linked to the PKK armed
  group.


  The arms will be deployed mainly in northern Syria, avoiding tension with
  Israel in the southwest.
