Air pollution in Delhi soared to dangerous levels on Tuesday, with PM 2.5 concentrations reaching an average of 488 µg/m³ — a 212% rise compared to pre-Diwali levels. A recent report links this sharp increase to firecracker emissions, even as stubble-burning cases in Punjab and Haryana saw a major decline this October.
