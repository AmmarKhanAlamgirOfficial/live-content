  Iraqi Prime Minister Shia al-Sudani has vowed to disarm all non-state actors,
  including Iranian-backed groups.


  The disarming will begin once the US begins its withdrawal in September of
  2026. The different factions will be absorbed by the Iraqi Armed Forces but
  they'll retain their own individual commanders.
