Cairo has begun discussions on the list of Palestinian prisoners proposed for release under the exchange agreement.

Hamas has demanded the release of Marwan Barghouti, Ahmad Sa’adat, Hassan Salama, Abbas al-Sayed, and others, in return for all hostages and recovered bodies.

Al-Qahira further reported that Hamas has requested details regarding the procedures and mechanisms for implementing the Trump plan, along with assurances that Israel will not resume attacks on Gaza.
