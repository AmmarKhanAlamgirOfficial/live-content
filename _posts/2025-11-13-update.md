Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when asked about New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani:

– "Am I afraid of going there (New York)? Hell, no. Of course not."

– "It’s good to be a young leader, but it’s not good to be a young, uneducated leader in the sense of not knowing economics, not knowing what antisemitism is, not knowing who the bad guys are. I think you should brush up on that. Then we might have a conversation."

(Times of Israel)
