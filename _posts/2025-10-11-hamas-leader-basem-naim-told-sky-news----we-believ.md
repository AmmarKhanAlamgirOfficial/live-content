  Hamas leader Basem Naim told Sky News:


  “We believe and hope that President Trump will continue his personal
  involvement and exert maximum pressure on Netanyahu to meet his obligations —
  firstly, as outlined in the agreement, and secondly, under international law
  as an occupying power. I believe that without President Trump’s direct
  interference, this would not be possible.”
