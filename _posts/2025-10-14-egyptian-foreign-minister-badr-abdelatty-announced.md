  Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty announced the formation of a
  15-member Palestinian technocratic committee designated to administer Gaza in
  the postwar phase.


  The committee’s members, reviewed by Israel and endorsed by all factions —
  including Hamas — will oversee governance, daily administration, and
  reconstruction efforts under the supervision of a U.S.-led “Board of Peace.”
