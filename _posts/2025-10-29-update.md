ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·/ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦/ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Chairman of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, Ali Larijani: 

'The signing of a strategic military agreement between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a matter that pleases us. 

The Islamic World is in need of such brotherhood today. We no longer need speeches to resolve the region's issues, but rather action and cooperation. Such was the agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and we welcome it.'
