  Hamas's Qassam Brigades:


  – “We confirm the readiness of our teams to work on extracting the bodies of
  [Israeli captives] inside the yellow line simultaneously and in all locations
  as part of closing this file.”


  –  “We demand the intermediaries and the International Committee of the Red
  Cross to provide and equip the necessary equipment and teams to work on
  retrieving all the bodies simultaneously.”


  – “Yesterday, and in order not to hinder the delivery of bodies, we offered to
  hand over 3 samples from several unidentified bodies, but [Israel] refused to
  receive the samples and requested to receive the bodies for examination. We
  therefore handed the bodies over to preempt [Israel’s] claims.”
