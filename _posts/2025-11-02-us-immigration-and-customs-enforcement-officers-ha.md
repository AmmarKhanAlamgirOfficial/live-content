  US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have detained British
  journalist Sami Hamdi, who was touring the US to speak at Council on
  American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) events, at the San Francisco Airport on
  October 26.


  CAIR says his detention is linked to his outspoken criticism of Israel and was
  due to “urging of pro-Israel” lobby. Hamdi was due to speak at another CAIR
  event in Florida before being taken into custody.
