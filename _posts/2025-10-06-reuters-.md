ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°A Saudi business delegation headed by Prince Mansour bin Mohammad al-Saud is set to visit Pakistan this week to explore investment opportunities following the recent defence agreement.

The initial investment plans, estimated at around $1 billion, will focus on sectors such as technology, food, sports, and possibly defence, while major projects may hinge on Pakistanâ€™s progress in implementing economic reforms.
