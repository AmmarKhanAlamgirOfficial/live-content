  The widely circulated report by Israel Hayom is inaccurate and stems from a
  misinterpretation of Hezbollah’s open letter issued today.


  In reality, Hezbollah did not state that it would respond. The group merely
  informed the Lebanese government that ongoing violations are unlawful and
  could potentially prompt a response in the future. However, this does not
  indicate that any decision has been made, and the letter primarily emphasized
  allowing the Lebanese Army to handle the matter.
