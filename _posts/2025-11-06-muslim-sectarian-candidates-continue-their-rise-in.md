  Muslim sectarian candidates continue their rise in Britain. In two council
  by-elections yesterday in Burnley, independent Muslim candidates unseated
  their Labour rivals by huge margins. The same area last year elected one of
  the Gaza Independents to Parliament during the Labour landslide.

  for their own is set to continue.
