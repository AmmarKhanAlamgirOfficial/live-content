  Hezbollah’s Secretary‑General, Sheikh Naim Qassem, said the group is ready to
  defend itself but will not start a war; if conflict is imposed by Israel,
  “even if all we have are sticks, we will not allow a single Israeli to
  advance” and will fight to the end.

  His remarks respond to Hebrew‑language reports that the IDF may be preparing
  for operations in Lebanon.
