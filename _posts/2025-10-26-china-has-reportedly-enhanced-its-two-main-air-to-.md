  China has reportedly enhanced its two main air-to-air missiles—the long-range
  PL-15 and the short-range PL-10—using technology obtained from the UAE,
  improving their range, guidance accuracy, and countermeasure resistance by
  roughly 20–30%.


  The technology is believed to have originated from the UAE’s familiarity with
  Western missile systems such as France’s Mica and Britain’s ASRAAM.


  According to U.S. intelligence, the collaboration was detected through
  satellite imagery and signals intelligence, raising alarms in Washington about
  growing defense cooperation between China and the UAE and the possible
  transfer of Western-origin technology.
