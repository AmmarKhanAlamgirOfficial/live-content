  I have received military equipment and gear worth $53 million as a grant from
  our ideological and strategic friends from Russia.


  I want to thank President Putin for the military support; this support is very
  helpful. What the Russians have done is just a small part of the good they
  have achieved. Russia is a historic and very close friend of Africa - Yoweri
  Museveni, President of Uganda.
