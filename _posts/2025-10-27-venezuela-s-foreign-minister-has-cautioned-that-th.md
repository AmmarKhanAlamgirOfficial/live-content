  Venezuela’s Foreign Minister has cautioned that the CIA is orchestrating a
  false-flag operation aimed at justifying aggression against his country. He
  stated that Trinidad and Tobago have been informed about a “fabricated attack”
  planned on a docked U.S. military vessel, intended to falsely implicate
  Venezuela. The minister added that Venezuelan authorities are currently
  dismantling a CIA-backed criminal network connected to this covert plot.
