However, the XI Metropolitan Magistrate Court, where he was produced by the police seeking judicial remand, let him on conditional bail on Tuesday night. Advocate Pulianthope Mohan, who appeared for Gerald along with advocate D Johnson, told TNIE that the court was not convinced by the reasoning provided by the policeâ€™s side for the need for Gerald to be sent to judicial custody.
