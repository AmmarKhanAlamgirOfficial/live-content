<p>To our heroic brothers in the Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements:</p>

<p>We are not concerned with the details of the negotiations because the decision is in your hands, but we remain committed to the covenant.</p>

<p>Just as our supporting military operations began at your request, they will not stop except at your request and will resume whenever you ask.</p>

<p>Your fate is our fate, and we are with you until victory or martyrdom”.</p>

<p>“And the wrongdoers will come to know what ˹evil˺ end they will meet.”</p>
