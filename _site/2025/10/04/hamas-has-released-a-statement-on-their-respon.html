<p>“In order to stop the aggression and war of extermination that our steadfast people in the Gaza Strip are being subjected to, and in accordance with national responsibility, and in order to preserve our people’s constants, rights, and supreme interests, the Islamic Resistance Movement “Hamas” has conducted in-depth consultations with its leadership institutions, extensive consultations with Palestinian forces and factions, and consultations with brotherly mediators and friends, to reach a responsible position in dealing with US President Donald Trump’s plan.</p>

<p>After thorough study, the movement has taken its decision and handed over its response to the mediators as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas appreciates the Arab, Islamic, and international efforts and those of US President Donald Trump calling for an end to the war on Gaza, prisoner exchange, immediate entry of aid, rejection of occupation, and rejection of the displacement of our Palestinian people.</li>
  <li>In this context and in order to achieve a ceasefire and complete withdrawal from Gaza, the movement announces its approval of the release of all Israeli prisoners, alive or dead, according to the exchange formula included in President Trump’s proposal, provided that field conditions are available for the exchange process.</li>
  <li>In this context, the movement confirms its readiness to immediately enter into negotiations through mediators to discuss details.</li>
  <li>The movement also renews its approval for handing over Gaza’s administration to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and relying on Arab and Islamic support.</li>
  <li>As for other issues mentioned in President Trump’s proposal related to Gaza’s future and the inherent rights of the Palestinian people, this is linked to a comprehensive national position based on relevant international laws and decisions. These will be discussed within a comprehensive Palestinian national framework where Hamas will be part of it and contribute responsibly.”</li>
